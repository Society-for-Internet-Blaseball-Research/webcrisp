# 1995 salmon software, on the web
This is an on-going project to build a web interface for [CRiSP Harvest](www.cbr.washington.edu/analysis/archive/harvest/crispharvest), "a user-friendly computer model that simulates the harvest of 30 chinook salmon stocks by 25 fisheries over an extended time horizon.".

## Copyright;
This relies on CRiSP Harvest v3.0.6, developed by UW Columbia Basin Research and released on October 29, 1997 for Windows 95. The official CRiSP website<link> states that “this is freely distributed software”; we are actively working to better understand the intended license structure for it.

### how do i use this
*notice: crisp.sibr.dev is not yet live.*

for now, you can post a json file generated with [salmon_lib](https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/salmon_lib) (an example is provided under sim.json on this repo) to `crisp.sibr.dev/api/sim`.
the result is a json response as generated by salmon_lib.
`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @sim.json https://crisp.sibr.dev/api/sim`

### how do i host this
you can build & run the docker images for the api under the `api/` folder using the provided `build.sh` and `docker-compose.yml` files c:
those will host the api at `http://localhost:9999/api/sim`.
